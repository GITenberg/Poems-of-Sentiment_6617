<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>DOUBLE
CARNATIONS</h2>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wild Pink nestled in a
garden bed,<br />
A rich Carnation flourished high above her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One day he chanced to see her pretty head<br />
And leaned and looked again, and grew to love her.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moss (her humble mother)
saw with fear<br />
The ardent glances of the princely stranger;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many an anxious thought and dewy tear<br />
She sought to hide her darling from this danger.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gardener-guardian of this
noble bud<br />
A cruel trellis interposed between them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No common Pink should mate with royal blood,<br />
He said, and sought in every way to wean them.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The poor Pink pined and faded day by
day:<br />
Her restless lover from his prison bower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Called in a priestly bee who passed that way,<br />
And sent a message to the sorrowing flower.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fainting Pink wept as the
bee drew near,<br />
Droning his prayers, and begged him to confess her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her weary mother, over-taxed by fear,<br />
Slept, while the priest leaned low to shrive and bless her.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lo! ere long the tale
went creeping out,<br />
The rich Carnation and the Pink were married!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cunning bee had brought the thing about<br />
While Mamma Moss in Slumber&rsquo;s arms had tarried.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And proud descendants of that
loving pair,<br />
The offspring of that true and ardent passion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are famous for their beauty everywhere,<br />
And leaders in the floral world of fashion.</p>
<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>NEVER
MIND</h2>
<p class="poetry">Whatever your work and whatever its worth,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter how strong or clever,<br />
Some one will sneer if you pause to hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And scoff at your best endeavour.<br />
For the target art has a broad expanse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wherever you chance to hit it,<br />
Though close be your aim to the bull&rsquo;s-eye fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those who will never admit it.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though the house applauds while the artist
plays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a smiling world adores him,<br />
Somebody is there with an ennuied air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To say that the acting bores him.<br />
For the tower of art has a lofty spire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many a stair and landing,<br />
And those who climb seem small oft-time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To one at the bottom standing.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>So work along in your chosen niche<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a steady purpose to nerve you;<br />
Let nothing men say who pass your way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Relax your courage or swerve you.<br />
The idle will flock by the Temple of Art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For just the pleasure of gazing;<br />
But climb to the top and do not stop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though they may not all be praising.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>TWO
WOMEN</h2>
<p class="poetry">I know two women, and one is chaste<br />
And cold as the snows on a winter waste,<br />
Stainless ever in act and thought<br />
(As a man, born dumb, in speech errs not).<br />
But she has malice toward her kind,<br />
A cruel tongue and a jealous mind.<br />
Void of pity and full of greed,<br />
She judges the world by her narrow creed;<br />
A brewer of quarrels, a breeder of hate,<br />
Yet she holds the key to &ldquo;Society&rsquo;s&rdquo; Gate.</p>
<p class="poetry">The other woman, with heart of flame,<br />
Went mad for a love that marred her name:<br />
And out of the grave of her murdered faith<br />
She rose like a soul that has passed through death.<br />
Her aims are noble, her pity so broad,<br />
It covers the world like the mercy of God.<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>A soother of
discord, a healer of woes,<br />
Peace follows her footsteps wherever she goes.<br />
The worthier life of the two, no doubt,<br />
And yet &ldquo;Society&rdquo; locks her out.</p>
<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>IT ALL
WILL COME OUT RIGHT</h2>
<p class="poetry">Whatever is a cruel wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever is unjust,<br />
The honest years that speed along<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will trample in the dust.<br />
In restless youth I railed at fate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all my puny might,<br />
But now I know if I but wait<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It all will come out right.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though Vice may don the judge&rsquo;s gown<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And play the censor&rsquo;s part,<br />
And Fact be cowed by Falsehood&rsquo;s frown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Nature ruled by art;<br />
Though Labour toils through blinding tears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And idle Wealth is might,<br />
I know the honest, earnest years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will bring it all out right.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Though poor and loveless creeds may pass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For pure religion&rsquo;s gold;<br />
Though ignorance may rule the mass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While truth meets glances cold,<br />
I know a law complete, sublime,<br />

<p class="poetry">There was a flame, oh! such a tiny
flame&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One fleeting hour had spanned its birth and
death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But for a silly child with playful breath<br />
Who fanned it into fury.&nbsp; It became<br />
A mighty conflagration.&nbsp; Ah, the cost!<br />
House, home, and thoughtless child alike were lost.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lady beware.&nbsp; Fan not the harmless glow<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of admiration into ardent love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lean not with red curled smiling lips above<br />
The flickering spark of sinless flame, and blow,<br />
Lest in the sudden waking of desire<br />
Thou, like the child, shalt perish in the fire.</p>

10</span>SHRINES</h2>
<p class="poetry">About a holy shrine or sacred place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where many hearts have bowed in earnest prayer,<br

The loveliest spirits congregate from space,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bring their sweet, uplifting influence
there.</p>
<p class="poetry">If in your chamber you pray oft and well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon will these angel-messengers arrive<br />
And make their home with you, and where they dwell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All worthy toil and purposes shall thrive.</p>
<p class="poetry">I know a humble, plainly furnished room,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So thronged with presences serene and bright,<br />
The heaviest heart therein forgets its gloom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As in some gorgeous temple filled with light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Those heavenly spirits, beauteous and
divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Live only in an atmosphere of prayer;<br />
Make for yourself a sacred, fervent shrine,<br />

A summer sunset swoon and sink away,<br />
Lost in the splendours of immortal art.<br />

With smiles undimmed by half a thousand years,<br />
From wall and niche have met my lifted gaze.<br />
Sculpture and carving and illumined page,<br />
And the fair, lofty dreams of architects,<br />
That speak of beauty to the centuries&mdash;<br />
All these have fed me with divine repasts.<br />
Yet in my mouth is left a bitter taste,<br />
The taste of blood that stained that age of art.</p>

Colossal genius and colossal crime<br />
Walk for a hundred years across the earth,<br />
Like giant twins?&nbsp; How was it then that men,<br />
Conceiving such vast beauty for the world,<br />
And such large hopes of heaven, could entertain<br />
Such hellish projects for their fellow-men?<br />
How could the hand that, with consummate skill<br />
And loving patience, limned the luminous page,<br />
Drop pen and brush, and seize the branding-rod,<br />
To scourge a brother for his differing faith?</p>
<p class="poetry">Not great this age in beauty or in art;<br />
Nothing is wrought to-day that shall endure,<br />
For earth&rsquo;s adornment, through long centuries<br />
Not ours the fervid worship of a God<br />
That wastes its splendid opulence on glass,<br />
Leaving but hate, to give it mortal kin.<br />
Yet great this age: its mighty work is man<br />
Knowing himself, the universal life.<br />

Or bright as one the ripe midsummer brings.<br />
The first faint note the forest warbler sings<br />
Is not as rich with feeling, or so rare<br />
As when, full master of his art, the air<br />
Drowns in the liquid sea of song he flings<br />
Like silver spray from beak, and breast, and wings.<br />
The artist&rsquo;s earliest effort, wrought with care,<br />
The bard&rsquo;s first ballad, written in his tears,<br />
Set by his later toil, seems poor and tame,<br />
And into nothing dwindles at the test.<br />
So with the passions of maturer years.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; To sudden, fierce desire.</p>

66</span>Who looks beneath life&rsquo;s outer crust<br />
Is satisfied that God is just;<br />
Who looks not under, but about,<br />
Finds much to make him sad with doubt.<br />
For Virtue walks with feet worn bare,<br />
While Sin rides by with coach and pair:<br />
Men praise the modest heart and chaste,<br />
And yet they let it go to waste,<br />
And follow, fierce to have and hold,<br />
Some creature, wanton, selfish, bold.</p>
<p class="poetry">She saw but this, life&rsquo;s outer side,<br

No higher faith was hers to guide;<br />
She worshipped gold, and hated toil,<br />
And hence her youth with all its soil,<br />
With all its sins too dark to name,<br />
Of secret crimes and public shame,<br />
With all its trail of broken lives,<br />
Of ruined homes, neglected wives,<br />
And weeping mothers.&nbsp; Proud and gay<br />
She went her devastating way<br />
With untouched brow and fadeless grace.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not time, but feeling, marks the face.<br />
Sin on the outer being tells<br />
Not till the startled soul rebels:<br />
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>And she
felt nothing but content.<br />
She was too light and indolent<br />
To worry over days to come.<br />
This little earth held all life&rsquo;s sum,<br />
She thought, and to be young and fair,<br />
Well clothed, well fed, was all her care.<br />
With pitying eyes and lifted head<br />
She gazed on those who toiled for bread,<br />
And laughed to scorn the talk she heard<br />
Of punishment for those who erred,<br />
And virtue&rsquo;s certain recompense.<br />
She seemed devoid of moral sense,<br />
An ignorant thing whose appetites<br />
Bound her horizon of delights.</p>
<p class="poetry">Men were her puppets to control;<br />
Unconscious of a heart or soul<br />
She lived, and gloried in the ease<br />
She purchased by her power to please<br />
The eye and senses.&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s one woe<br />
Which caused her pitying tears to flow<br />
Was poverty.&nbsp; Though hearts might break<br />
And homes be ruined for her sake,<br />
She showed no mercy.&nbsp; But when need<br />
Of gold she saw, her heart would bleed.<br />
The lack of clothing, fire, and food<br />
Was earth&rsquo;s one pain, she understood.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>The suffering poor oft blest her name,<br />
Nor questioned whence the ducats came,<br />
She gave so freely.&nbsp; Once she found<br />
A fainting woman on the ground,<br />
A wailing child clasped to her breast.<br />
With her own hands she bathed and dressed<br />
The weary waifs! gave food and gold<br />
And clothed them warmly from the cold,<br />
Nor guessed that one she lured from home<br />
Had caused that suffering pair to roam<br />
Unhoused, neglected.&nbsp; Then one day,<br />
Unheralded across her way,<br />
The conqueror came.&nbsp; She knew not why,<br />
But with the first glance of his eye<br />
A feeling, new and unexplained,<br />
Woke in her what she oft had feigned.<br />
And when his arm stole near her waist,<br />
As startled maidens blush with chaste<br />
Sweet fear at love&rsquo;s advances, so<br />
She blushed from brow to breast of snow.<br />
Strange, new emotions, fraught with joy<br />
And pain commingled, made her coy;<br />
But when he would have clasped her neck<br />
With gems that might a queen bedeck<br />
And offered gold, her lips grew white<br />
With sudden anger at the sight<br />
<a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Of what
had been her god for years.<br />
She flung them from her.&nbsp; Then such tears<br />
As only spring from love&rsquo;s despair<br />
Welled from her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;So, lady fair,<br />
My gifts are scorned?&rdquo; quoth he, and laughed.<br />
&ldquo;Like Cleopatra, you have quaffed<br />
Such lordly pearls in draughts of wine,<br />
You spurn poor simple gems like mine.<br />
Well, well, fair queen, I&rsquo;ll bring to you<br />
A richer gift next time.&nbsp; Adieu.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">His light words stung like lash of whip;<br />
With gasping breath and ashen lip<br />
She strove to speak, but he was gone<br />
She kneeled and pressed her mouth upon<br />
The latch his hand had touched, the floor<br />
His foot had trod, and o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er<br />
She sobbed his name, as children moan<br />
A mother&rsquo;s name when left alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">Out from the dim and roseate gloom<br />
And subtle odours of her room<br />
Accusing memories rose.&nbsp; She felt<br />
A loneliness that seemed to belt<br />
The universe in its embrace.<br />
It was as if from some high place<br />
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>A giant
hand had reached and hurled<br />
To nothingness her petty world,<br />
And left her staring, awed, alone,<br />
Up into regions vast, unknown.<br />
There is no other loneliness<br />
That can so sadden and oppress<br />
As when beside the burned-out fire<br />
Of sated passion and desire<br />
The wakening spirit, in a glance,<br />
Beholds its lost inheritance.<br />
She rose and turned the dim lights higher,<br />
Brought forth rich gems and grand attire,<br />
And robed herself in feverish haste;<br />
Before the mirror posed and paced,<br />
With jewels on her breast and wrists;<br />
Then sudden clenched her little fists<br />
And beat her face until it bled,<br />
And tore her garments shred from shred,<br />
Gazed in the mirror, spoke her name<br />
And hissed a word that told her shame,<br />
Then on her knees fell sobbing there.</p>
<p class="poetry">There are sweet messengers of prayer<br />
Who down through space on soft wings steal,<br />
And offer aid to all who kneel.<br />
Her lips, unused to pious phrase,<br />
Recalled some words of bygone days,<br />
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>And
&ldquo;Now I lay me down to sleep,<br />
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,&rdquo;<br />
She whispered timidly, and then,<br />
&ldquo;Lord, let me be a child again<br />
And grow up good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The strange prayer said,<br />
Like some o&rsquo;er-weary child, her head<br />
She pillowed on her arm, and wept<br />
Low, shuddering sobs, until she slept<br />
And dreamed; and in that dream she thought<br />
She sat within a vine-wreathed cot;<br />
An infant slumbered on her breast,<br />
She crooned a lullaby, and pressed<br />
Its waxen hand against her cheek,<br />
While one, too proud and fond to speak,<br />
The happy father of the child,<br />
Stood near, and gazing on them, smiled.</p>
<p class="poetry">She woke while still the lullaby<br />
Was on her lips&mdash;then such a cry,<br />
As souls in fabled realms below<br />
Might utter, voiced her awful woe.</p>
<p class="poetry">The mighty moral labour-pain<br />
Of new-born conscience wracked her brain<br />
And tore her soul.&nbsp; She understood<br />
The meaning now of womanhood,<br />
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>And
chastity, and o&rsquo;er her came<br />
The full, dark sense of all her shame.<br />
As some poor drunken wretch, at night,<br />
Wakes up to know his piteous plight,<br />
And sees, while sinking in the mire,<br />
Afar, his waiting hearth-light&rsquo;s fire;<br />
So now she saw from depths of sin<br />
The hearth-light of the might-have-been.<br />
How beautiful, how like a star<br />
That lost light shone, but ah, how far!</p>
<p class="poetry">She reached her longing arms toward space,<br
/>
And lifted up her tear-wet face.<br />
&ldquo;O God,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;I have been bad!<br />
I see it all, and I am sad,<br />
And long to be a good girl now.<br />
Lord, Lord, will some one show me how?<br />
Why, men have trod the burning track<br />
Of sin for years, and then gone back!<br />
And cannot I for sin atone,<br />
Or did Christ die for men alone?<br />
I want to lead an honest life,<br />
I want to be his own true wife<br />
And hold upon my breast his child.&rdquo;<br />
Then suddenly her voice grew wild,<br />
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it could not be&mdash;<br
/>
Those infant eyes would torture me:<br />
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Though God
condoned my sinful ways,<br />
I could not meet my child&rsquo;s pure gaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She hid her face upon her knees,<br />
And swayed as reeds sway in a breeze.<br />
&ldquo;O Christ,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;could I forget,<br />
There might be something for me yet:<br />
But though both God and man forgave,<br />
And I should win the love I crave,<br />
Why, memory would drive me mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">When woman drifts from good to bad,<br />
To make her final fall complete,<br />
She puts her soul beneath her feet.<br />
Man&rsquo;s dual selves seem separate;<br />
He leaves his soul outside sin&rsquo;s gate,<br />
And finds it waiting when he tires<br />
Of carnal pleasures and desires,<br />
Depleted, sickened, and depressed,<br />
As souls must be with such a test,<br />
Yet strong enough to help him grope<br />
Back into happiness and hope.<br />
But woman, far more complicate,<br />
Can take no chances with her fate;<br />
A subtle creature, finely spun,<br />
Her body and her soul are one.<br />
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>And now
this erring woman wept<br />
The soul she murdered while it slept.<br />
She felt too stunned with pain to think.<br />
She seemed to stand upon a brink;<br />
Behind her loomed the sinful past,<br />
Below her, rocks, beyond her, vast<br />
And awful darkness.&nbsp; Not one ray<br />
Of sun or star to show the way!<br />
She drew a long and shuddering breath;<br />
&ldquo;There is no other path but death<br />
For me to tread,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;and so<br />
I will prepare my house and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">As housewives move with willing feet<br />
And skilful hands to make things neat<br />
And ready for some welcome one,<br />
She toiled until her tasks were done.<br />
Then, seated at her desk, she wrote,<br />
With painful care, a tear-wet note.<br />
The childish penmanship was rude,<br />
Ill spelled the words, the phrasing crude;<br />
Yet thought and feeling both were there,<br />
And mighty love and great despair.<br />
&ldquo;Dear heart,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;you did not know<br />
How, from the first, I loved you so,<br />
That sin grew hateful in my sight;<br />
And so I leave it all to-night.<br />
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>The kiss I
gave, dear heart, to you<br />
Was love&rsquo;s first kiss, as pure and true<br />

Among the hapless, homeless dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;When God formed worlds, He failed to

A path for erring feet to take<br />
Back into light and peace again,<br />
Unless they were the feet of men.<br />
When woman errs, and then regrets,<br />
Her sun of hope for ever sets,<br />
And life is hung with deepest gloom.<br />
In all the world there is no room<br />
For such as she; and so I hold<br />
That death itself is not so cold<br />
As life has seemed, since by love&rsquo;s light<br />
I saw there was a wrong and right,<br />
And that my birthright had been sold,<br />
By my own hands, for tarnished gold.<br />
I hated labour, hence I fell;<br />
But now I love you, dear, so well,<br />
No greater boon my soul could crave<br />
Than just to toil, a galley-slave,<br />
Through burdened years and years of life,<br />
If at the last you called me wife<br />
<a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>For one
supreme and honoured hour.<br />
Alas! too late I learn love&rsquo;s power,<br />
Too late I realise my loss,<br />

There cannot be another place<br />
So desolate, so full of fear,<br />
As earth to me, without you, dear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;You will not understand, I know,<br />
How one like me can love you so.<br />
It was a strange, strange thing.&nbsp; Love came<br />
So like a swift, devouring flame<br />
And burned my frail, fair-weather boat<br />
And left me on the waves afloat,<br />
With nothing but a broken spar.<br />
The distant shores seem very far;<br />
I cannot reach them, so I sink.<br />
God will forgive my sins, I think,<br />
Because I die for love, like One<br />
The good Book tells about, His Son.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;For erring woman death can bring<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; How oft mine eyes are dim,<br />
Or that my lingering caress<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems more and more intricate, complex, and dual,<br

Because in your bosom there wages the strife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twixt an angel of light and a beast that is
cruel&mdash;<br />
An angel who whispers your spirit has wings,<br />
And a beast who would chain you to temporal things.</p>

The beast has his purpose; he need not be slain:<br />
He should serve the good angel in harness and chain.</p>
<p class="poetry">The body that never knows carnal desires,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart that to passion is always a stranger,<br

Is merely a furnace with unlighted fires;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; That passionate feeling has no counterfeit.<br />
Chief jewel from Jove&rsquo;s crown &rsquo;twas sent men, lent<br

For inspiration and for sacrament.</p>
<p class="poetry">Jove never could have made the Universe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had he not glowed with passion&rsquo;s sacred

Though man oft turns the blessing to a curse,<br />

Though scarred the soul be where its light burns bright,<br />
Yet where it is not, neither is there might.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea, it was set in Jove&rsquo;s resplendent
crown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he created worlds; that done, why, hence,<br />

And that is how he sees and hears our tears<br />
Unmoved and calm from the eternal spheres.</p>

Who have no souls to be inspired or fired,<br />
Mere sport of idle gods who have grown tired.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; At their own shadows, think the world no higher;<br

And when they see the all-creative spark<br />

&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;<br />
And shriek, and rave, till their dissent is spent,<br />
While listening gods laugh loud in merriment.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
