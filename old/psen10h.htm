<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>DOUBLE CARNATIONS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wild Pink nestled in a garden bed,<br />A rich
Carnation flourished high above her,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day
he chanced to see her pretty head<br />And leaned and looked again,
and grew to love her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moss (her humble mother) saw with fear<br />The
ardent glances of the princely stranger;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
many an anxious thought and dewy tear<br />She sought to hide her darling
from this danger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gardener-guardian of this noble bud<br />A
cruel trellis interposed between them.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No common
Pink should mate with royal blood,<br />He said, and sought in every
way to wean them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor Pink pined and faded day by day:<br />Her
restless lover from his prison bower<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called in
a priestly bee who passed that way,<br />And sent a message to the sorrowing
flower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fainting Pink wept as the bee drew near,<br />Droning
his prayers, and begged him to confess her.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
weary mother, over-taxed by fear,<br />Slept, while the priest leaned
low to shrive and bless her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lo! ere long the tale went creeping out,<br />The
rich Carnation and the Pink were married!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cunning bee had brought the thing about<br />While Mamma Moss in Slumber&rsquo;s
arms had tarried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And proud descendants of that loving pair,<br />The
offspring of that true and ardent passion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
famous for their beauty everywhere,<br />And leaders in the floral world
of fashion.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>NEVER MIND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Whatever your work and whatever its worth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
matter how strong or clever,<br />Some one will sneer if you pause to
hear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scoff at your best endeavour.<br />For
the target art has a broad expanse,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wherever
you chance to hit it,<br />Though close be your aim to the bull&rsquo;s-eye
fame,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those who will never admit it.</p>
<p>Though the house applauds while the artist plays,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
a smiling world adores him,<br />Somebody is there with an ennuied air<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
say that the acting bores him.<br />For the tower of art has a lofty
spire,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a stair and landing,<br />And
those who climb seem small oft-time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one at
the bottom standing.</p>
<p>So work along in your chosen niche<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a
steady purpose to nerve you;<br />Let nothing men say who pass your
way<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relax your courage or swerve you.<br />The
idle will flock by the Temple of Art<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For just
the pleasure of gazing;<br />But climb to the top and do not stop,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
they may not all be praising.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>TWO WOMEN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I know two women, and one is chaste<br />And cold as the snows on
a winter waste,<br />Stainless ever in act and thought<br />(As a man,
born dumb, in speech errs not).<br />But she has malice toward her kind,<br />A
cruel tongue and a jealous mind.<br />Void of pity and full of greed,<br />She
judges the world by her narrow creed;<br />A brewer of quarrels, a breeder
of hate,<br />Yet she holds the key to &ldquo;Society&rsquo;s&rdquo;
Gate.</p>
<p>The other woman, with heart of flame,<br />Went mad for a love that
marred her name:<br />And out of the grave of her murdered faith<br />She
rose like a soul that has passed through death.<br />Her aims are noble,
her pity so broad,<br />It covers the world like the mercy of God.<br />A
soother of discord, a healer of woes,<br />Peace follows her footsteps
wherever she goes.<br />The worthier life of the two, no doubt,<br />And
yet &ldquo;Society&rdquo; locks her out.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Whatever is a cruel wrong,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever is unjust,<br />The
honest years that speed along<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will trample in
the dust.<br />In restless youth I railed at fate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
all my puny might,<br />But now I know if I but wait<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
all will come out right.</p>
<p>Though Vice may don the judge&rsquo;s gown<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
play the censor&rsquo;s part,<br />And Fact be cowed by Falsehood&rsquo;s
frown<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nature ruled by art;<br />Though Labour
toils through blinding tears<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And idle Wealth
is might,<br />I know the honest, earnest years<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will
bring it all out right.</p>
<p>Though poor and loveless creeds may pass<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
pure religion&rsquo;s gold;<br />Though ignorance may rule the mass<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
truth meets glances cold,<br />I know a law complete, sublime,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controls
us with its might,<br />And in God&rsquo;s own appointed time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
all will come out right.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A WARNING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There was a flame, oh! such a tiny flame -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
fleeting hour had spanned its birth and death,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
for a silly child with playful breath<br />Who fanned it into fury.&nbsp;
It became<br />A mighty conflagration.&nbsp; Ah, the cost!<br />House,
home, and thoughtless child alike were lost.</p>
<p>Lady beware.&nbsp; Fan not the harmless glow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
admiration into ardent love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean not with red
curled smiling lips above<br />The flickering spark of sinless flame,
and blow,<br />Lest in the sudden waking of desire<br />Thou, like the
child, shalt perish in the fire.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SHRINES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>About a holy shrine or sacred place,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
many hearts have bowed in earnest prayer,<br />The loveliest spirits
congregate from space,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring their sweet,
uplifting influence there.</p>
<p>If in your chamber you pray oft and well,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon
will these angel-messengers arrive<br />And make their home with you,
and where they dwell<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All worthy toil and purposes
shall thrive.</p>
<p>I know a humble, plainly furnished room,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
thronged with presences serene and bright,<br />The heaviest heart therein
forgets its gloom<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in some gorgeous temple
filled with light.</p>
<p>Those heavenly spirits, beauteous and divine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live
only in an atmosphere of prayer;<br />Make for yourself a sacred, fervent
shrine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you will find them swiftly flocking
there.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE WATCHER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>She gave her soul and body for a carriage,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
livened lackey with a vacant grin,<br />And all the rest - house, lands
- and called it marriage:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargain made, a
husband was thrown in.</p>
<p>And now, despite her luxury, she&rsquo;s faded,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone
is the bloom that was so fresh and bright;<br />She has the dark-rimmed
eye, the countenance jaded,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one who watches
with the sick at night.</p>
<p>Ah, heaven, she does! her sick heart, sick and dying,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond
the aid of human skill to save,<br />In that cold room her breast is
hourly lying,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her grim thoughts crowd near
to dig its grave.</p>
<p>And yet it lingers, suffering and wailing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
sick hearts will that feed upon despair,<br />And that lone watcher,
unrelieved, is paling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With vigils that no pitying
soul can share.</p>
<p>Ah, lady! it is hardly what you thought it,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
life of luxury and social power;<br />You gave yourself as principal,
and bought it,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But God extracts the interest
hour by hour.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SWIMMING SONG</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am coming, coming to thee,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My
strong-armed lover, the Sea!<br />On thy great broad breast I will lie
and rest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou shalt talk to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come to thee, all unsought,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have stolen an hour from thought,<br />And peace and power thou canst
give in that hour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which thy rival Earth gives
not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone here, under the sky,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the whole world drifting by!<br />Thy breast of brine thrills close
to mine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the cloudless sun sails high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fly, but thou givest chase -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy
kisses are on my face!<br />Be bold and free as thou wilt, O Sea,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is life in thy close embrace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throat and cheek and tress<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
damp where thy salt lips press!<br />There is strength and bliss in
thy daring kiss,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And joy in thy bold caress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is the Earth to me!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have left it all, O Sea!<br />With its dust and soil and strife and
toil,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one glad hour with thee.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE LAW</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The sun may be clouded, yet ever the sun<br />Will sweep on its course
till the cycle is run.<br />And when into chaos the systems are hurled,<br />Again
shall the Builder reshape a new world.</p>
<p>Your path may be clouded, uncertain your goal;<br />Move on, for
the orbit is fixed for your soul.<br />And though it may lead into darkness
of night,<br />The torch of the Builder shall give it new light.</p>
<p>You were, and you will be: know this while you are.<br />Your spirit
has travelled both long and afar.<br />It came from the Source, to the
Source it returns;<br />The spark that was lighted, eternally burns.</p>
<p>It slept in the jewel, it leaped in the wave,<br />It roamed in the
forest, it rose in the grave,<br />It took on strange garbs for long
&aelig;ons of years,<br />And now in the soul of yourself it appears.</p>
<p>From body to body your spirit speeds on;<br />It seeks a new form
when the old one is gone;<br />And the form that it finds is the fabric
you wrought<br />On the loom of the mind, with the fibre of thought.</p>
<p>As dew is drawn upward, in rain to descend,<br />Your thoughts drift
away and in destiny blend.<br />You cannot escape them; or petty, or
great,<br />Or evil, or noble, they fashion your fate.</p>
<p>Somewhere on some planet, sometime and somehow,<br />Your life will
reflect all the thoughts of your now.<br />The law is unerring; no blood
can atone;<br />The structure you rear you must live in alone.</p>
<p>From cycle to cycle, through time and through space,<br />Your lives
with your longings will ever keep pace.<br />And all that you ask for,
and all you desire,<br />Must come at your bidding, as flames out of
fire.</p>
<p>Once list to that voice and all tumult is done,<br />Your life is
the life of the Infinite One;<br />In the hurrying race you are conscious
of pause,<br />With love for the purpose and love for the cause.</p>
<p>You are your own devil, you are your own God,<br />You fashioned
the paths that your footsteps have trod,<br />And no one can save you
from error or sin,<br />Until you shall hark to the Spirit within.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LOVE, TIME, AND WILL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A soul immortal, Time, God everywhere,<br />Without, within - how
can a heart despair,<br />Or talk of failure, obstacles, and doubt?<br />(What
proofs of God?&nbsp; The little seeds that sprout,<br />Life, and the
solar system, and their laws.<br />Nature?&nbsp; Ah, yes; but what was
Nature&rsquo;s cause?)</p>
<p>All mighty words are short: God, life, and death,<br />War, peace,
and truth, are uttered in a breath.<br />And briefly said are love,
and will, and time;<br />Yet in them lies a majesty sublime.</p>
<p>Love is the vast constructive power of space;<br />Time is the hour
which calls it into place;<br />Will is the means of using time and
love,<br />And bringing forth the heart&rsquo;s desires thereof.</p>
<p>The way is love, the time is now, and will<br />The patient method.&nbsp;
Let this knowledge fill<br />Thy consciousness, and fate and circumstance,<br />Environment,
and all the ills of chance<br />Must yield before the concentrated might<br />Of
those three words, as shadows yield to light.</p>
<p>Go, charge thyself with love; be infinite<br />And opulent with thy
large use of it:<br />&rsquo;Tis from free sowing that full harvest
springs;<br />Love God and life and all created things.</p>
<p>Learn time&rsquo;s great value; to this mandate bow,<br />The hour
of opportunity is Now,<br />And from thy will, as from a well-strung
bow,<br />Let the swift arrows of thy wishes go.<br />Though sent into
the distance and the dark,<br />The dawn shall prove thy arrows hit
the mark.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE TWO AGES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>On great cathedral window I have seen<br />A summer sunset swoon
and sink away,<br />Lost in the splendours of immortal art.<br />Angels
and saints and all the heavenly hosts,<br />With smiles undimmed by
half a thousand years,<br />From wall and niche have met my lifted gaze.<br />Sculpture
and carving and illumined page,<br />And the fair, lofty dreams of architects,<br />That
speak of beauty to the centuries -<br />All these have fed me with divine
repasts.<br />Yet in my mouth is left a bitter taste,<br />The taste
of blood that stained that age of art.</p>
<p>Those glorious windows shine upon the black<br />And hideous structure
of the guillotine;<br />Beside the haloed countenance of saints<br />There
hangs the multiple and knotted lash.<br />The Christ of love, benign
and beautiful,<br />Looks at the torture-rack, by hate conceived<br />And
bigotry sustained.&nbsp; The prison cell,<br />With blood-stained walls,
where starving men went mad,<br />Lies under turrets matchless in their
grace.</p>
<p>God, what an age!&nbsp; How was it that You let<br />Colossal genius
and colossal crime<br />Walk for a hundred years across the earth,<br />Like
giant twins?&nbsp; How was it then that men,<br />Conceiving such vast
beauty for the world,<br />And such large hopes of heaven, could entertain<br />Such
hellish projects for their fellow-men?<br />How could the hand that,
with consummate skill<br />And loving patience, limned the luminous
page,<br />Drop pen and brush, and seize the branding-rod,<br />To scourge
a brother for his differing faith?</p>
<p>Not great this age in beauty or in art;<br />Nothing is wrought to-day
that shall endure,<br />For earth&rsquo;s adornment, through long centuries<br />Not
ours the fervid worship of a God<br />That wastes its splendid opulence
on glass,<br />Leaving but hate, to give it mortal kin.<br />Yet great
this age: its mighty work is man<br />Knowing himself, the universal
life.<br />And great our faith, which shows itself in works<br />For
human freedom and for racial good.<br />The true religion lies in being
kind.<br />No age is greater than its faith is broad.<br />Through liberty
and love men climb to God.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>COULEUR DE ROSE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I want more lives in which to love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world
so full of beauty,<br />I want more days to use the ways<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
know of doing duty;<br />I ask no greater joy than this<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(So
much I am life&rsquo;s lover),<br />When I reach age to turn the page<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
read the story over.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O love, stay near!)</p>
<p>O rapturous promise of the Spring!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O June
fulfilling after!<br />If Autumns sigh, when Summers die,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis
drowned in Winter&rsquo;s laughter.<br />O maiden dawns, O wifely noons,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O
siren sweet, sweet nights,<br />I&rsquo;d want no heaven could earth
be given<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again with its delights<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(If
love stayed near).</p>
<p>There are such glories for the eye,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such pleasures
for the ear,<br />The senses reel with all they feel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
see and taste and hear;<br />There are such ways of doing good,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
ways of being kind,<br />And bread that&rsquo;s cast on waters fast<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes
home again, I find.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O love, stay near.)</p>
<p>There are such royal souls to know,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is so much to learn,<br />While secrets rest in Nature&rsquo;s breast<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
unnamed stars still burn.<br />God toiled six days to make this earth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
think the good folks say -<br />Six lives we need to give full meed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
praise - one for each day<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(If love stay near).</p>
<p>But oh! if love fled far away,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or veiled his
face from me,<br />One life too much, why then were such<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
life as this would be.<br />With sullen May and blighted June,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blurred
dawn and haggard night,<br />This dear old world in space were hurled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
love lent not his light.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O love, stay near!)</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LAST LOVE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The first flower of the spring is not so fair<br />Or bright as one
the ripe midsummer brings.<br />The first faint note the forest warbler
sings<br />Is not as rich with feeling, or so rare<br />As when, full
master of his art, the air<br />Drowns in the liquid sea of song he
flings<br />Like silver spray from beak, and breast, and wings.<br />The
artist&rsquo;s earliest effort, wrought with care,<br />The bard&rsquo;s
first ballad, written in his tears,<br />Set by his later toil, seems
poor and tame,<br />And into nothing dwindles at the test.<br />So with
the passions of maturer years.<br />Let those who will demand the first
fond flame,<br />Give me the heart&rsquo;s <i>last love</i>, for that
is best.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LIFE&rsquo;S TRACK</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>This game of life is a dangerous play,<br />Each human soul must
watch alway,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first to the very last.<br />I
care not however strong and pure -<br />Let no man say he is perfectly
sure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangerous reefs are past.</p>
<p>For many a rock may lurk near by,<br />That never is seen when the
tide is high -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let no man dare to boast,<br />When
the hand is full of trumps - beware,<br />For that is the time when
thought and care<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nerve are needed most.</p>
<p>As the oldest jockey knows to his cost,<br />Full many a well-run
race is lost<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief half length from the wire.<br />And
many a soul that has fought with sin,<br />And gained each battle, at
last gives in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sudden, fierce desire.</p>
<p>And vain seems the effort of spur and whip,<br />Or the hoarse, hot
cry of the pallid lip,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When once we have fallen
back.<br />It is better to keep on stirrup and rein,<br />The steady
poise and the careful strain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speeding along
Life&rsquo;s track.</p>
<p>A watchful eye and a strong, true hand<br />Will carry us under the
Judge&rsquo;s stand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If prayer, too, does its
part;<br />And little by little the struggling soul<br />Will grow and
strengthen and gain control<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the passionate
heart.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>AN ODE TO TIME</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Ho! sportsman Time, whose chargers fleet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
moments, madly driven,<br />Beat in the dust beneath their feet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet
hopes that years have given;<br />Turn, turn aside those reckless steeds,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh!
do not urge them my way;<br />There&rsquo;s nothing that Time wants
or needs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this contented by-way.</p>
<p>You have down-trodden, in your race,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much
that proves your power,<br />Why not avoid my humble place?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
rob me of my dower?<br />With your vast cellars, cavern deep,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packed
tier on tier with treasures,<br />You would not miss them should I <i>keep<br /></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My
little store of pleasures.</p>
<p>As one who, frightened, flying, flings<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
riches down at random,<br />Your course is paved with precious things<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life
casts before your tandem:<br />The warrior&rsquo;s fame, the conqueror&rsquo;s
crown,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great creeds for ages cherished,<br />Beneath
your chariot-wheels were thrown,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, crushed
to earth, they perished.</p>
<p>Although to just and generous deeds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your heart
is not a stranger,<br />I have the feeling that one needs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
guard his wealth from danger.<br />And though a most heroic light<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft
on your pathway lingers,<br />I&rsquo;d hide my treasures, if I might,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
contact with your fingers.</p>
<p>You are the loyal friend of Truth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go seek
her, make her stronger,<br />And leave the remnant of my youth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
me a little longer.<br />There&rsquo;s work enough for you before<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternity
shall wed you:<br />Why stoop to steal my simple store?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
make me shun and dread you?</p>
<p>You do not need my joys, I say,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home, love,
and friends united -<br />I beg you turn and go the way<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
wrong waits to be righted;<br />Or pause, and let us chat a while:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll
listen - not too near you,<br />For oh! no matter how you smile,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
fear you, Time, I fear you!</p>

<h2>REGRET AND REMORSE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Regret with streaming eyes doth seem alway<br />A maiden widowed
on her wedding day.</p>
<p>While dark Remorse, with eyes too sad for tears,<br />A crushed,
desponding Magdalene appears.</p>
<p>One, with a hungering heart unsatisfied,<br />Mourns for imagined
joys that were denied.</p>
<p>The other, pierced by recollected sin,<br />Broods o&rsquo;er the
scars of pleasures that have been.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>EASTER MORN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A truth that has long lain buried<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Superstition&rsquo;s
door,<br />I see, in the dawn uprising<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all
its strength once more.</p>
<p>Hidden away in the darkness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Ignorance
crucified,<br />Crushed under stones of dogmas -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet
lo! it has not died.</p>
<p>It stands in the light transfigured,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It speaks
from the heights above,<br />&ldquo;<i>Each soul is its own redeemer</i>;<br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is no law but Love</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the spirits of men are gladdened<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they
welcome this Truth re-born<br />With its feet on the grave of Error<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
its eyes to the Easter Morn.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>BLIND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Whatever a man may think or feel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can tell
to the world and it hears aright;<br />But it bids the woman conceal,
conceal,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And woe to the thoughts that at last
ignite.<br />She may serve up gossip or dwell on fashion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
play the critic with speech unkind,<br />But alas for the woman who
speaks with passion!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the world is blind -
for the world is blind.</p>
<p>It is woman who sits with her starved desire,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
drinks to sorrow in cups of tears;<br />She reads by the light of her
soul on fire<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secrets of love through lonely
years:<br />But out of all she has felt or heard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
read by the glow of her soul&rsquo;s white flame,<br />If she dare but
utter aloud one word -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the world cries shame!
- how the world cries shame!</p>
<p>It cannot distinguish between the glow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
a gleaming star, in the sky of gold,<br />Or a spent cigar in the dust
below -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twixt unclad Eve or a wanton bold;<br />And
ever if woman speaks what she feels<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And feels
consistent with God&rsquo;s great plan)<br />It has cast her under its
juggernaut wheels,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the world began - since
the world began.</p>

<h2>THE YELLOW-COVERED ALMANAC</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I left the farm when mother died and changed my place of dwelling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
daughter Susie&rsquo;s stylish house right on the city street:<br />And
there was them before I came that sort of scared me, telling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How
I would find the town folks&rsquo; ways so difficult to meet;<br />They
said I&rsquo;d have no comfort in the rustling, fixed-up throng,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
I&rsquo;d have to wear stiff collars every week-day, right along.</p>
<p>I find I take to city ways just like a duck to water;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
like the racket and the noise and never tire of shows;<br />And there&rsquo;s
no end of comfort in the mansion of my daughter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
everything is right at hand and money freely flows;<br />And hired help
is all about, just listenin&rsquo; to my call -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
I miss the yellow almanac off my old kitchen wall.</p>
<p>The house is full of calendars from attic to the cellar,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re
painted in all colours and are fancy like to see,<br />But in this one
particular I&rsquo;m not a modern feller,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the yellow-coloured almanac is good enough for me.<br />I&rsquo;m used
to it, I&rsquo;ve seen it round from boyhood to old age,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
I rather like the jokin&rsquo; at the bottom of the cage.</p>
<p>I like the way its &ldquo;S&rdquo; stood out to show the week&rsquo;s
beginning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In these new-fangled calendars the
days seem sort of mixed),<br />And the man upon the cover, though he
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t exactly winnin&rsquo;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
lungs and liver all exposed, still showed how we are fixed;<br />And
the letters and credentials that was writ to Mr. Ayer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve
often on a rainy day found readin&rsquo; pretty fair.</p>
<p>I tried to buy one recently; there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t none in the
city!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They toted out great calendars, in every
shape and style.<br />I looked at &rsquo;em in cold disdain, and answered
&rsquo;em in pity -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have
my almanac than all that costly pile.&rdquo;<br />And though I take
to city life, I&rsquo;m lonesome after all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
that old yellow almanac upon my kitchen wall.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s baby was buried to-day -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
empty white hearse from the grave rumbled back,<br />And the morning
somehow seemed less smiling and gay<br />As I paused on the walk while
it crossed on its way,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a shadow seemed drawn
o&rsquo;er the sun&rsquo;s golden tract.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s baby was laid out to rest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White
as a snowdrop, and fair to behold,<br />And the soft little hands were
crossed over the breast,<br />And those hands and the lips and the eyelids
were pressed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With kisses as hot as the eyelids
were cold.</p>
<p>Somebody saw it go out of her sight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the coffin lid - out through the door;<br />Somebody finds only darkness
and blight<br />All through the glory of summer-sun light;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody&rsquo;s
baby will waken no more.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s sorrow is making me weep:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
know not her name, hut I echo her cry,<br />For the dearly bought baby
she longed so to keep,<br />The baby that rode to its long-lasting sleep<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the little white hearse that went rumbling by.</p>
<p>I know not her name, but her sorrow I know;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
I paused on the crossing I lived it once more,<br />And back to my heart
surged that river of woe<br />That but in the breast of a mother can
flow;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the little white hearse has been, too,
at <i>my</i> door.</p>

<h2>REALISATION<br />(At the Old Homestead)</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I tread the paths of earlier times<br />Where all my steps were set
to rhymes.</p>
<p>I gaze on scenes I used to see<br />When dreaming of a vague To be.</p>
<p>I walk in ways made bright of old<br />By hopes youth-limned in hues
of gold.</p>
<p>But lo! those hopes of future bliss<br />Seem dull beside the joy
that <i>is.</i></p>
<p>My noonday skies are far more bright<br />Than those dreamed of in
morning&rsquo;s light,</p>
<p>And life gives me more joys to hold<br />Than all it promised me
of old.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SUCCESS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>As we gaze up life&rsquo;s slope, as we gaze<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the morn, ere the dewdrops are dry,<br />What splendour hangs over the
ways,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What glory gleams there in the sky,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
pleasures seem waiting us, high<br />On the peak of that beauteous slope,<br />What
rainbow-hued colours of hope,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
we gaze!</p>
<p>As we climb up the hill, as we climb,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
hearts, our illusions, are rent:<br />For Fate, who is spouse of old
Time,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is jealous of youth and content.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
brows that are brooding and bent<br />She shadows our sunlight of gold,<br />And
the way grows lonely and cold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
we climb.</p>
<p>As we toil on, through trouble and pain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are hands that will shelter and feed;<br />But once let us dare to <i>attain
-<br /></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will bruise our bare hearts till they
bleed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis the worst of all crimes to
succeed,<br />Know this as ye feast on a crust,<br />Know this in the
darkness and dust,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who climb.</p>
<p>As we stand on the heights of success,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo!
success seems as sad as defeat!<br />Through the lives we may succour
and bless<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone may its litter turn sweet!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the world lying there at our feet,<br />With its cavilling praise and
its sneer,<br />We must pity, condone, but not hear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
we stand.</p>
<p>As we live on those heights, we must live<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
the courage and pride of a god;<br />For the world, it has nothing to
give<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the scourge of the lash and the rod.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
thoughts must be noble and broad,<br />Our purpose must challenge men&rsquo;s
gaze,<br />While we seek not their blame or their praise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
we live.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE LADY AND THE DAME</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>So, thou hast the art, good dame, thou swearest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
keep Time&rsquo;s perishing touch at bay<br />From the roseate splendour
of the cheek so tender,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the silver threads
from the gold away.<br />And the tell-tale years that have hurried by
us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall tip-toe back, and, with kind good-will,<br />They
shall take the traces from off our faces,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we will trust to thy magic skill.</p>
<p>Thou speakest fairly; but if I listen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
buy thy secret, and prove its truth,<br />Hast thou the potion and magic
lotion<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give me also the <i>heart</i> of youth?<br />With
the cheek of rose and the eye of beauty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the lustrous looks of life&rsquo;s lost prime,<br />Wilt thou bring
thronging each hope and longing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made the
glory of that dead Time?</p>
<p>When the sap in the trees sets young buds bursting,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the song of the birds fills the air like spray,<br />Will rivers of
feeling come once more stealing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beautiful
hills of the far-away?<br />Wilt thou demolish the tower of reason,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
fling for ever down into the dust<br />The caution time brought me,
the lessons life taught me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put in their
places my old sweet trust?</p>
<p>If Time&rsquo;s foot-print from my brow is driven,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canst
thou, too, take with thy subtle powers<br />The burden of thinking,
and let me go drinking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The careless pleasures
of youth&rsquo;s bright hours?<br />If silver threads from my tresses
vanish,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a glow once more in my pale cheek
gleams,<br />Wilt thou slay duty and give back the beauty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
days untroubled by aught but dreams?</p>
<p>When the soft fair arms of the siren Summer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encircle
the earth in their languorous fold,<br />Will vast, deep oceans of sweet
emotions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surge through my veins as they surged
of old?<br />Canst thou bring back from a day long-vanished<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
leaping pulse and the boundless aim?<br />I will pay thee double, for
all thy trouble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou wilt restore all these,
good dame.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>HEAVEN AND HELL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>While forced to dwell apart from thy dear face,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love,
robed like sorrow, led me by the hand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taught
my doubting heart to understand<br />That which has puzzled all the
human race.<br />Full many a sage has questioned where in space<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those
counter worlds were? where the mystic strand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
separates them?&nbsp; I have found each land,<br />And Hell is vast,
and Heaven a narrow space.</p>
<p>In the small compass of thy clasping arms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
reach and sight of thy dear lips and eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There,
there for me the joy of Heaven lies.<br />Outside, lo! chaos, terrors&rsquo;
wild alarms,<br />And all the desolation fierce and fell<br />Of void
and aching nothingness, makes Hell.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LOVE&rsquo;S SUPREMACY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>As yon great Sun in his supreme condition<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absorbs
small worlds and makes them all his own,<br />So does my love absorb
each vain ambition,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each outside purpose which
my life has known.<br />Stars cannot shine so near that vast orb&rsquo;d
splendour;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are content to feed his flames
of fire:<br />And so my heart is satisfied to render<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its
strength, its all, to meet thy strong desire.</p>
<p>As in a forest when dead leaves are falling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
all save some perennial green tree,<br />So one by one I find all pleasures
palling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That are not linked with or enjoyed by
thee.<br />And all the homage that the world may proffer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
take as perfumed oils or incense sweet,<br />And think of it as one
thing more to offer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sacrifice to Love, at
thy dear feet.</p>
<p>I love myself because thou art my lover,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My
name seems dear since uttered by thy voice;<br />Yet, argus-eyed, I
watch and would discover<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each blemish in the
object of thy choice.<br />I coldly sit in judgment on each error,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
my soul&rsquo;s gaze I hold each fault of me,<br />Until my pride is
lost in abject terror,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest I become inadequate
to thee.</p>
<p>Like some swift-rushing and sea-seeking river,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which
gathers force the farther on it goes,<br />So does the current of my
love forever<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find added strength and beauty as
it flows.<br />The more I give, the more remains for giving,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
more receive, the more remains to win.<br />Ah! only in eternities of
living<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will life be long enough to love thee
in.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE ETERNAL WILL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There is no thing we cannot overcome<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say not
thy evil instinct is inherited,<br />Or that some trait inborn makes
thy whole life forlorn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And calls down punishment
that is not merited.</p>
<p>Back of thy parents and grandparents lies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Great Eternal Will.&nbsp; That, too, is thine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inheritance;
strong, beautiful, divine,<br />Sure lever of success for one who tries.</p>
<p>Pry up thy faults with this great lever, Will.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However
deeply bedded in propensity,<br />However firmly set, I tell thee firmer
yet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that vast power that comes from Truth&rsquo;s
immensity.</p>
<p>Thou art a part of that strange world, I say.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its
forces lie within thee, stronger far<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than all
thy mortal sins and frailties are,<br />Believe thyself divine, and
watch, and pray.</p>
<p>There is no noble height thou canst not climb.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
triumphs may be thine in Time&rsquo;s futurity,<br />If whatso&rsquo;er
thy fault, thou dost not faint or halt,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lean
upon the staff of God&rsquo;s security.</p>
<p>Earth has no claim the soul can not contest.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know
thyself part of that Eternal Source,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And naught
can stand before thy spirit&rsquo;s force.<br />The soul&rsquo;s divine
inheritance is best.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>INSIGHT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>On the river of life, as I float along,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
see with the spirit&rsquo;s sight<br />That many a nauseous weed of
wrong<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has root in a seed of right.<br />For evil
is good that has gone astray,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sorrow is only
blindness,<br />And the world is always under the sway<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
a changeless law of kindness.</p>
<p>The commonest error a truth can make<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is shouting
its sweet voice hoarse,<br />And sin is only the soul&rsquo;s mistake<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
misdirecting its force.<br />And love, the fairest of all fair things<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
ever to man descended,<br />Grows rank with nettles and poisonous things<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
it is watched and tended.</p>
<p>There could not be anything better than this<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old
world in the way it began;<br />And though some matters have gone amiss<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
the great original plan,<br />And however dark the skies may appear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
however souls may blunder,<br />I tell you it all will work out clear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
good lies over and under.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A WOMAN&rsquo;S LOVE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>So vast the tide of love within me surging,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
overflows like some stupendous sea,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confines
of the Present and To-be;<br />And &rsquo;gainst the Past&rsquo;s high
wall I feel it urging,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it would cry, &ldquo;Thou,
too, shalt yield to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All other loves my supreme love embodies;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
would be she on whose soft bosom nursed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy clinging
infant lips to quench their thirst;<br />She who trod close to hidden
worlds where God is,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she might have, and
hold, and see thee first.</p>
<p>I would be she who stirred the vague, fond fancies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
thy still childish heart; who through bright days<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went
sporting with thee in the old-time plays,<br />And caught the sunlight
of thy boyish glances<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half-forgotten and long-buried
Mays.</p>
<p>Forth to the end, and back to the beginning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My
love would send its inundating tide,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein
all landmarks of thy past should hide.<br />If thy life&rsquo;s lesson
<i>must</i> be learned through sinning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grieving
virtue would become thy guide.</p>
<p>For I would share the burden of thy errors,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
when the sun of our brief life had set,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou
didst walk in darkness and regret,<br />E&rsquo;en in that shadowy world
of nameless terrors,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul and thine should
be companions yet.</p>
<p>And I would cross with thee those troubled oceans<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
dark remorse whose waters are despair:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things
my jealous, reckless love would dare,<br />So that thou mightst not
recollect emotions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which it did not have a
part and share.</p>
<p>There is no limit to my love&rsquo;s full measure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s
spirit-gold is shaped by earth&rsquo;s alloy;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
would be friend and mother, mate and toy,<br />I&rsquo;d have thee look
to me for every pleasure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in me find all
memories of joy.</p>
<p>Yet though I love thee in such selfish fashion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
would wait on thee, sitting at thy feet,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
serving thee, if thou didst deem it meet.<br />And couldst thou give
me one fond hour of passion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d take that
hour and call my life complete.</p>

<h2>THE P&AElig;AN OF PEACE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>With ever some wrong to be righting,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
self ever seeking for place,<br />The world has been striving and fighting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
man was evolved out of space.<br />Bold history into dark regions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His
torchlight has fearlessly cast,<br />He shows us tribes warring in legions,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
jungles of ages long passed.</p>
<p>Religion, forgetting her station,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting
her birthright from God,<br />Set nation to warring with nation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
scattered dissension abroad.<br />Dear creeds have made men kill each
other,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair faith has bred hate and despair,<br />And
brother has battled with brother<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of a
difference in prayer.</p>
<p>But earth has grown wiser and kinder,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
man is evolving a soul:<br />From wars of an age that was blinder,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
rise to a peace-girdled goal.<br />Where once men would murder in treason<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
slaughter each other in hordes,<br />They now meet together and reason,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
thoughts for their weapons, not swords.</p>
<p>The brute in humanity dwindles<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lessens
as time speeds along,<br />And the spark of Divinity kindles<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
blazes up brightly and strong.<br />The seer can behold in the distance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
race that shall people the world -<br />Strong men of a godlike existence<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unarmed,
and with war banners furled.</p>
<p>No longer the bloodthirsty savage<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man&rsquo;s
vast spirit strength shall unfold;<br />And tales of red warfare and
ravage<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall seem like ghost stories of old.<br />For
the booming of guns and the rattle<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of carnage
and conflict shall cease,<br />And the bugle-call, leading to battle,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall
change to a p&aelig;an of peace.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>&ldquo;HAS BEEN&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>That melancholy phrase &ldquo;It might have been,&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However
sad, doth in its heart enfold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hidden germ of
promise! for I hold<br /><i>Whatever might have been shall be.<br /></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
in<br />Some other realm and life, the soul must win<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
goal that erst was possible.&nbsp; But cold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
cruel as the sound of frozen mould<br />Dropped on a coffin, are the
words &ldquo;Has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been beautiful&rdquo; - &ldquo;he has been great,&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rome
has been powerful,&rdquo; we sigh and say.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is the pitying crust we toss decay,<br />The dirge we breathe o&rsquo;er
some degenerate state,<br />An epitaph for fame&rsquo;s unburied dead.<br />God
pity those who live to hear it said!</p>

<h2>DUTY&rsquo;S PATH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Out from the harbour of youth&rsquo;s bay<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
leads the path of pleasure;<br />With eager steps we walk that way<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
brim joy&rsquo;s largest measure.<br />But when with morn&rsquo;s departing
beam<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes youth&rsquo;s last precious minute,<br />We
sigh &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas but a fevered dream -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s
nothing in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then on our vision dawns afar<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of
glory, gleaming<br />Like some great radiant solar star,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
sets us longing, dreaming.<br />Forgetting all things left behind,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
strain each nerve to win it,<br />But when &rsquo;tis ours - alas! we
find<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing in it.</p>
<p>We turn our sad, reluctant gaze<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the path
of duty;<br />Its barren, uninviting ways<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
void of bloom and beauty.<br />Yet in that road, though dark and cold,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
seems as we begin it,<br />As we press on - lo! we behold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s
Heaven in it.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>MARCH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Like some reformer, who with mien austere,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neglected
dress, and loud insistent tones,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More rasping
than the wrongs which she bemoans,<br />Walks through the land and wearies
all who hear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet we know the need of such
reform;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So comes unlovely March, with wind and
storm,<br />To break the spell of winter, and set free<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
poisoned brooks and crocus beds oppressed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe
of face, gaunt-armed, and wildly dressed,<br />She is not fair nor beautiful
to see.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But merry April and sweet smiling May<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come
not till March has first prepared the way.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE END OF THE SUMMER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The birds laugh loud and long together<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
Fashion&rsquo;s followers speed away<br />At the first cool breath of
autumn weather.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, this is the time, cry the
birds, to stay!<br />When the deep calm sea and the deep sky over<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both
look their passion through sun-kissed space,<br />As a blue-eyed maid
and her blue-eyed lover<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might each gaze into
the other&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Oh! this is the time when careful spying<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovers
the secrets Nature knows.<br />You find when the butterflies plan for
flying<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Before the thrush or the blackbird goes),<br />You
see some day by the water&rsquo;s edges<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brilliant
border of red and black;<br />And then off over the hills and hedges<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
flutters away on the summer&rsquo;s track.</p>
<p>The shy little sumacs, in lonely places,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowed
all summer with dust and heat,<br />Like clean-clad children with rain-washed
faces,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are dressed in scarlet from head to feet.<br />And
never a flower had the boastful summer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all
the blossoms that decked her sod,<br />So royal hued as that later comer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
purple chum of the goldenrod.</p>
<p>Some chill grey dawn you note with grieving<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
the King of Autumn is on his way.<br />You see, with a sorrowful, slow
believing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the wanton woods have gone astray.<br />They
wear the stain of bold caresses,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of riotous revels
with old King Frost;<br />They dazzle all eyes with their gorgeous dresses,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor
care that their green young leaves are lost.</p>
<p>A wet wind blows from the East one morning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
wood&rsquo;s gay garments looked draggled out.<br />You hear a sound,
and your heart takes warning -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds are
planning their winter route.<br />They wheel and settle and scold and
wrangle,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tempers are ruffled, their voices
loud;<br />Then <i>whirr</i> - and away in a feathered tangle,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
fade in the south like a passing cloud.</p>
<p><i>Envoi</i></p>
<p>A songless wood stripped bare of glory -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
sodden moor that is black and brown;<br />The year has finished its
last love-story:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! let us away to the gay bright
town.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SUN SHADOWS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There never was success so nobly gained,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
victory so free from selfish dross,<br />But in the winning some one
had been pained<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or some one suffered loss.</p>
<p>There never was so nobly planned a f&ecirc;te,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
festal throng with hearts on pleasure bent,<br />But some neglected
one outside the gate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wept tears of discontent.</p>
<p>There never was a bridal morning fair<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
hope&rsquo;s blue skies and love&rsquo;s unclouded sun<br />For two
fond hearts, that did not bring despair<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some
sad other one.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>&ldquo;HE THAT LOOKETH&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Yea, she and I have broken God&rsquo;s command,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
in His sight are branded with our shame.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
yet I do not even know her name,<br />Nor ever in my life have touched
her hand<br />Or brushed her garments.&nbsp; But I chanced to stand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside
her in the throng!&nbsp; A sweet, swift flame<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot
from her flesh to mine - and hers the blame<br />Of willing looks that
fed it; aye, that fanned<br />The glow within me to a hungry fire.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
was an invitation in her eyes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had she met mine
with coldness or surprise,<br />I had not plunged on headlong in the
mire<br />Of amorous thought.&nbsp; The flame leaped high and higher;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
breath and mine pulsated into sighs,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soft
glance melted into glance kiss-wise,<br />And in God&rsquo;s sight both
yielded to desire.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>AN ERRING WOMAN&rsquo;S LOVE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>PART I</p>
<p>She was a light and wanton maid:<br />Not one whom fickle Love betrayed,<br />For
indolence was her undoer.<br />Fair, frivolous, and very poor,<br />She
scorned the thought of toil, in youth,<br />And chose the path that
leads from truth.</p>
<p>More women fall from want of gold<br />Than love leads wrong, if
truth were told;<br />More women sin for gay attire<br />Than sin through
passion&rsquo;s blinding fire.<br />Her god was gold: and gold she saw<br />Prove
mightier than the sternest law<br />With judge and jury, priest and
king;<br />So, made herself an offering<br />At Mammon&rsquo;s shrine;
and lived for power,<br />And ease, and pleasures of the hour.</p>
<p>Who looks beneath life&rsquo;s outer crust<br />Is satisfied that
God is just;<br />Who looks not under, but about,<br />Finds much to
make him sad with doubt.<br />For Virtue walks with feet worn bare,<br />While
Sin rides by with coach and pair:<br />Men praise the modest heart and
chaste,<br />And yet they let it go to waste,<br />And follow, fierce
to have and hold,<br />Some creature, wanton, selfish, bold.</p>
<p>She saw but this, life&rsquo;s outer side,<br />No higher faith was
hers to guide;<br />She worshipped gold, and hated toil,<br />And hence
her youth with all its soil,<br />With all its sins too dark to name,<br />Of
secret crimes and public shame,<br />With all its trail of broken lives,<br />Of
ruined homes, neglected wives,<br />And weeping mothers.&nbsp; Proud
and gay<br />She went her devastating way<br />With untouched brow and
fadeless grace.</p>
<p>Not time, but feeling, marks the face.<br />Sin on the outer being
tells<br />Not till the startled soul rebels:<br />And she felt nothing
but content.<br />She was too light and indolent<br />To worry over
days to come.<br />This little earth held all life&rsquo;s sum,<br />She
thought, and to be young and fair,<br />Well clothed, well fed, was
all her care.<br />With pitying eyes and lifted head<br />She gazed
on those who toiled for bread,<br />And laughed to scorn the talk she
heard<br />Of punishment for those who erred,<br />And virtue&rsquo;s
certain recompense.<br />She seemed devoid of moral sense,<br />An ignorant
thing whose appetites<br />Bound her horizon of delights.</p>
<p>Men were her puppets to control;<br />Unconscious of a heart or soul<br />She
lived, and gloried in the ease<br />She purchased by her power to please<br />The
eye and senses.&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s one woe<br />Which caused her pitying
tears to flow<br />Was poverty.&nbsp; Though hearts might break<br />And
homes be ruined for her sake,<br />She showed no mercy.&nbsp; But when
need<br />Of gold she saw, her heart would bleed.<br />The lack of clothing,
fire, and food<br />Was earth&rsquo;s one pain, she understood.</p>
<p>The suffering poor oft blest her name,<br />Nor questioned whence
the ducats came,<br />She gave so freely.&nbsp; Once she found<br />A
fainting woman on the ground,<br />A wailing child clasped to her breast.<br />With
her own hands she bathed and dressed<br />The weary waifs! gave food
and gold<br />And clothed them warmly from the cold,<br />Nor guessed
that one she lured from home<br />Had caused that suffering pair to
roam<br />Unhoused, neglected.&nbsp; Then one day,<br />Unheralded across
her way,<br />The conqueror came.&nbsp; She knew not why,<br />But with
the first glance of his eye<br />A feeling, new and unexplained,<br />Woke
in her what she oft had feigned.<br />And when his arm stole near her
waist,<br />As startled maidens blush with chaste<br />Sweet fear at
love&rsquo;s advances, so<br />She blushed from brow to breast of snow.<br />Strange,
new emotions, fraught with joy<br />And pain commingled, made her coy;<br />But
when he would have clasped her neck<br />With gems that might a queen
bedeck<br />And offered gold, her lips grew white<br />With sudden anger
at the sight<br />Of what had been her god for years.<br />She flung
them from her.&nbsp; Then such tears<br />As only spring from love&rsquo;s
despair<br />Welled from her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;So, lady fair,<br />My
gifts are scorned?&rdquo; quoth he, and laughed.<br />&ldquo;Like Cleopatra,
you have quaffed<br />Such lordly pearls in draughts of wine,<br />You
spurn poor simple gems like mine.<br />Well, well, fair queen, I&rsquo;ll
bring to you<br />A richer gift next time.&nbsp; Adieu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His light words stung like lash of whip;<br />With gasping breath
and ashen lip<br />She strove to speak, but he was gone<br />She kneeled
and pressed her mouth upon<br />The latch his hand had touched, the
floor<br />His foot had trod, and o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er<br />She
sobbed his name, as children moan<br />A mother&rsquo;s name when left
alone.</p>
<p>Out from the dim and roseate gloom<br />And subtle odours of her
room<br />Accusing memories rose.&nbsp; She felt<br />A loneliness that
seemed to belt<br />The universe in its embrace.<br />It was as if from
some high place<br />A giant hand had reached and hurled<br />To nothingness
her petty world,<br />And left her staring, awed, alone,<br />Up into
regions vast, unknown.<br />There is no other loneliness<br />That can
so sadden and oppress<br />As when beside the burned-out fire<br />Of
sated passion and desire<br />The wakening spirit, in a glance,<br />Beholds
its lost inheritance.<br />She rose and turned the dim lights higher,<br />Brought
forth rich gems and grand attire,<br />And robed herself in feverish
haste;<br />Before the mirror posed and paced,<br />With jewels on her
breast and wrists;<br />Then sudden clenched her little fists<br />And
beat her face until it bled,<br />And tore her garments shred from shred,<br />Gazed
in the mirror, spoke her name<br />And hissed a word that told her shame,<br />Then
on her knees fell sobbing there.</p>
<p>There are sweet messengers of prayer<br />Who down through space
on soft wings steal,<br />And offer aid to all who kneel.<br />Her lips,
unused to pious phrase,<br />Recalled some words of bygone days,<br />And
&ldquo;Now I lay me down to sleep,<br />I pray the Lord my soul to keep,&rdquo;<br />She
whispered timidly, and then,<br />&ldquo;Lord, let me be a child again<br />And
grow up good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The strange prayer said,<br />Like some o&rsquo;er-weary
child, her head<br />She pillowed on her arm, and wept<br />Low, shuddering
sobs, until she slept<br />And dreamed; and in that dream she thought<br />She
sat within a vine-wreathed cot;<br />An infant slumbered on her breast,<br />She
crooned a lullaby, and pressed<br />Its waxen hand against her cheek,<br />While
one, too proud and fond to speak,<br />The happy father of the child,<br />Stood
near, and gazing on them, smiled.</p>
<p>She woke while still the lullaby<br />Was on her lips - then such
a cry,<br />As souls in fabled realms below<br />Might utter, voiced
her awful woe.</p>
<p>The mighty moral labour-pain<br />Of new-born conscience wracked
her brain<br />And tore her soul.&nbsp; She understood<br />The meaning
now of womanhood,<br />And chastity, and o&rsquo;er her came<br />The
full, dark sense of all her shame.<br />As some poor drunken wretch,
at night,<br />Wakes up to know his piteous plight,<br />And sees, while
sinking in the mire,<br />Afar, his waiting hearth-light&rsquo;s fire;<br />So
now she saw from depths of sin<br />The hearth-light of the might-have-been.<br />How
beautiful, how like a star<br />That lost light shone, but ah, how far!</p>
<p>She reached her longing arms toward space,<br />And lifted up her
tear-wet face.<br />&ldquo;O God,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;I have been
bad!<br />I see it all, and I am sad,<br />And long to be a good girl
now.<br />Lord, Lord, will some one show me how?<br />Why, men have
trod the burning track<br />Of sin for years, and then gone back!<br />And
cannot I for sin atone,<br />Or did Christ die for men alone?<br />I
want to lead an honest life,<br />I want to be his own true wife<br />And
hold upon my breast his child.&rdquo;<br />Then suddenly her voice grew
wild,<br />&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it could not be -<br />Those
infant eyes would torture me:<br />Though God condoned my sinful ways,<br />I
could not meet my child&rsquo;s pure gaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hid her face upon her knees,<br />And swayed as reeds sway in
a breeze.<br />&ldquo;O Christ,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;could I forget,<br />There
might be something for me yet:<br />But though both God and man forgave,<br />And
I should win the love I crave,<br />Why, memory would drive me mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When woman drifts from good to bad,<br />To make her final fall complete,<br />She
puts her soul beneath her feet.<br />Man&rsquo;s dual selves seem separate;<br />He
leaves his soul outside sin&rsquo;s gate,<br />And finds it waiting
when he tires<br />Of carnal pleasures and desires,<br />Depleted, sickened,
and depressed,<br />As souls must be with such a test,<br />Yet strong
enough to help him grope<br />Back into happiness and hope.<br />But
woman, far more complicate,<br />Can take no chances with her fate;<br />A
subtle creature, finely spun,<br />Her body and her soul are one.<br />And
now this erring woman wept<br />The soul she murdered while it slept.<br />She
felt too stunned with pain to think.<br />She seemed to stand upon a
brink;<br />Behind her loomed the sinful past,<br />Below her, rocks,
beyond her, vast<br />And awful darkness.&nbsp; Not one ray<br />Of
sun or star to show the way!<br />She drew a long and shuddering breath;<br />&ldquo;There
is no other path but death<br />For me to tread,&rdquo; she sighed,
&ldquo;and so<br />I will prepare my house and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As housewives move with willing feet<br />And skilful hands to make
things neat<br />And ready for some welcome one,<br />She toiled until
her tasks were done.<br />Then, seated at her desk, she wrote,<br />With
painful care, a tear-wet note.<br />The childish penmanship was rude,<br />Ill
spelled the words, the phrasing crude;<br />Yet thought and feeling
both were there,<br />And mighty love and great despair.<br />&ldquo;Dear
heart,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;you did not know<br />How, from the first,
I loved you so,<br />That sin grew hateful in my sight;<br />And so
I leave it all to-night.<br />The kiss I gave, dear heart, to you<br />Was
love&rsquo;s first kiss, as pure and true<br />As ever lips of maiden
gave.<br />I think &rsquo;twill warm my lonely grave,<br />And light
the pathway I must tread<br />Among the hapless, homeless dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When God formed worlds, He failed to make<br />A path for
erring feet to take<br />Back into light and peace again,<br />Unless
they were the feet of men.<br />When woman errs, and then regrets,<br />Her
sun of hope for ever sets,<br />And life is hung with deepest gloom.<br />In
all the world there is no room<br />For such as she; and so I hold<br />That
death itself is not so cold<br />As life has seemed, since by love&rsquo;s
light<br />I saw there was a wrong and right,<br />And that my birthright
had been sold,<br />By my own hands, for tarnished gold.<br />I hated
labour, hence I fell;<br />But now I love you, dear, so well,<br />No
greater boon my soul could crave<br />Than just to toil, a galley-slave,<br />Through
burdened years and years of life,<br />If at the last you called me
wife<br />For one supreme and honoured hour.<br />Alas! too late I learn
love&rsquo;s power,<br />Too late I realise my loss,<br />And have no
strength to bear my cross<br />Of loneliness and dark disgrace.<br />There
cannot be another place<br />So desolate, so full of fear,<br />As earth
to me, without you, dear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not understand, I know,<br />How one like me can
love you so.<br />It was a strange, strange thing.&nbsp; Love came<br />So
like a swift, devouring flame<br />And burned my frail, fair-weather
boat<br />And left me on the waves afloat,<br />With nothing but a broken
spar.<br />The distant shores seem very far;<br />I cannot reach them,
so I sink.<br />God will forgive my sins, I think,<br />Because I die
for love, like One<br />The good Book tells about, His Son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For erring woman death can bring<br />No pain so keen as memory&rsquo;s
sting.<br />Good-night, good-bye.&nbsp; God bless you, dear,<br />And
give you love, and joy, and cheer!<br />But sometimes, in the dark night,
say<br />A prayer for one who went astray,<br />And found no pathway
back, and died<br />For love of you - a suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When morn his glorious pinions spread,<br />They found the erring
woman, dead.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>PART II</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>She woke as one wakes from a deep<br />And dreamless, yet exhausting,
sleep.</p>
<p>A strange confusion filled her mind,<br />And sorrows vague and undefined,</p>
<p>Like half-remembered faces pressed<br />To memory&rsquo;s window,
in her breast,</p>
<p>Gazed at her with reproachful eyes.<br />She felt a sudden, dazed
surprise,</p>
<p>Commingled with a sense of dread,<br />&ldquo;I did but sleep - I
am not dead,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The potion and the purpose failed,<br />And I still live,&rdquo;
she wildly wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, thou art dead, rash suicide,&rdquo;<br />A sad voice
spake: and at her side</p>
<p>She saw a weird and shadowy crowd<br />With anguished lips, and shoulders
bowed,</p>
<p>And orbs that seemed the wells of woe.<br />She shrieked and veiled
her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not dead!&nbsp; I ache with life.<br />An earthly passion&rsquo;s
hopeless strife</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still tortures me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet thou art dead,&rdquo;<br />The
voice with sad insistence said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But love and sorrow and regret<br />All die with death.&nbsp;
<i>I</i> feel them yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bade thee live, and only He<br />Can say when thou shalt
cease to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was sin-sick, sad, alone -<br />I thought by death I
could atone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And died that Christ might show me how.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Christ
bore His burden, why not thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! lead me to His holy feet<br />And let my penance be complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! thinkest thou to find that path -<br />Thou who hast
tempted Heaven&rsquo;s wrath</p>
<p>&ldquo;By thy rash deed?&nbsp; Nay, nay, not so,<br />&rsquo;Tis
but perfected spirits go</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that supreme and final goal.<br />A self-sought death delays
the soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With yonder shuddering, woeful throng<br />Of suicides thy
ways belong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close to the earth a shadowy band,<br />Unseen, but seeing
all, they stand</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until their natural time to die,<br />As God intended, shall
draw nigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On earth, repentant, sick of sin,<br />A ministering angel
thou hadst been</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose patient toil and deeds divine<br />Had rescued souls
as sad as thine,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each deed a firm ascending stair<br />To lead beyond thy great
despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now it is thy mournful fate<br />To linger here and meditate</p>
<p>&ldquo;On thy dark past - to stand so near<br />The earthly plane
that thou canst hear</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy lover&rsquo;s voice, while old desire<br />Shall burn
within thee like a fire,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And grief shall root thee to the spot<br />To find how soon
thou art forgot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But since thou hast endured the woes<br />That only fragile
woman knows,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And loved as only woman can,<br />Thou shalt not suffer all
that man</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must suffer when he interferes<br />With God&rsquo;s great
law.&nbsp; In death&rsquo;s dim spheres</p>
<p>&ldquo;That justice waits, which men refuse.<br />Thy sex shall in
some part excuse</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy desperate deed.&nbsp; When God shall send<br />A second
death to be thy friend,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou need&rsquo;st not fear a darker fate -<br />Go forth
with yonder throng, and wait.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A SONG OF REPUBLICS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Fair Freedom&rsquo;s ship, too long adrift -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
every wind the sport -<br />Now rigged and manned, her course well planned,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sails
proudly out of port;<br />And fluttering gaily from the mast<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
motto is unfurled,<br />Let all men heed its truth who read:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Republics
rule the World!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The universe is high as God!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good is the final
goal;<br />The world revolves and man evolves<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
purpose and a soul.<br />No church can bind, no crown forbid<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought&rsquo;s
mighty upward course -<br />Let kings give way before its sway,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
God inspires its force.</p>
<p>The hero of a vanished age<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was one who bathed
in gore;<br />Who best could fight was noblest knight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
savage days of yore;<br />Now warrior chiefs are out of date,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
times have changed.&nbsp; To-day<br />We call men great who arbitrate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
keep war&rsquo;s hounds at bay.</p>
<p>The world no longer looks to priest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or prince
to know its needs;<br />Earth&rsquo;s human throng has grown too strong<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
rule with courts and creeds.<br />We want no kings but kings of toil
-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No crowns but crowns of deeds;<br />Not royal
birth but sterling worth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must mark the man who
leads.</p>
<p>Proud monarchies are out of step<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With modern
thought to-day,<br />For Brotherhood is understood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
thrones may pass away.<br />Men dare to think.&nbsp; Concerted thought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contains
more power than swords:<br />The force that binds united minds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defeats
mere savage hordes.</p>
<p>Man needs no arbitrary hand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep him in
control;<br />He feels the power grow hour by hour<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
his expanding soul:<br />In God&rsquo;s stupendous scheme of worlds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
knows he has a place;<br />He is no slave to cringe, and crave<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
worthless monarch&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>As ocean billows undermine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haughty shores
each hour,<br />Time&rsquo;s sea has brought its waves of thought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
crumble thrones of power;<br />And one by one shall kingdoms fall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
leaves before the blast,<br />As man with man combines to plan<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Republics
formed to last.</p>
<p>Columbia baulked a tyrant king,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And built
upon a rock,<br />In Freedom&rsquo;s name, a shrine whose fame<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlived
the century&rsquo;s shock.<br />Now France within our port has set<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
symbol of re-birth;<br />Her lifted hand tells sea and land<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Republics
light the earth.</p>
<p>One mighty church for all the world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would
make men far more kind;<br />One government would bring content<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
many a restless mind.<br />Sail on, fair ship of Freedom, sail<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
wide sea&rsquo;s breadth and length.<br />&rsquo;Till worlds unite to
make the might<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of &ldquo;One Republic&rsquo;s&rdquo;
strength.</p>

<h2>MEMORIAL DAY - 1892</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The quiet graves of our country&rsquo;s braves<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
thirty Junes and Decembers<br />Have solemnly lain under sun and rain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
yet the Nation remembers.</p>
<p>The marching of feet and the flags on the street<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told
once again this morning,<br />In the voice of the drum how the day had
come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those lowly beds&rsquo; adorning.</p>
<p>Then swiftly back on Time&rsquo;s worn track<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His
three decades seemed driven,<br />And with startled eyes I saw arise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
graves by fancy riven,</p>
<p>The Gray and Blue in a grand review.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! vast
were the hosts they numbered,<br />As they wheeled and swayed in a dress
parade<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er the graves where they long
had slumbered.</p>
<p>The colours were not, as when they fought,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked
one against the other,<br />But a mingled hue of gray and blue,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
brother marching with brother.</p>
<p>And a blue flower lay on each coat of gray,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
forget-me-nots on a boulder;<br />And the gray moss lace in its Southern
grace<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was knotted on each blue shoulder.</p>
<p>The vision fled; but I think our dead,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
they could come back with the living,<br />Would clasp warm hands o&rsquo;er
hostile lands,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting old wrongs and forgiving.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Mong the blossoms of Spring that you gather and bring<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
graves that though lowly are royal,<br />Let the blue flower prevail,
though modest and pale,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it speaks of the
hue that was loyal.</p>
<p>But tie each bouquet with a ribbon of gray<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
lay it on memory&rsquo;s altar,<br />For the dead who fought for the
cause they thought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was right, and who did not
falter.</p>

<h2>WHEN BABY SOULS SAIL OUT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When from our mortal vision<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown men and
women go<br />To sail strange fields Elysian<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
know what spirits know,<br />I think of them as tourists,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
some sun-gilded clime,<br />&rsquo;Mong happy sights and dear delights<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
all shall find, in time.</p>
<p>But when a child goes yonder<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves its
mother here,<br />Its little feet must wander,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
seems to me, in fear.<br />What paths of Eden beauty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
scenes of peace and rest,<br />Can bring content to one who went<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth
from a mother&rsquo;s breast?</p>
<p>In palace gardens, lonely,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little child
will roam<br />And weep for pleasures only<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found
in its humble home.<br />It is not won by splendour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor
bought by costly toys;<br />To hide from harm on mother&rsquo;s arm<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes
all its sum of joys.</p>
<p>It must be when the baby<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes journeying off
alone,<br />Some angel (Mary, may be)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopts
it for her own.<br />Yet when a child is taken<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose
mother stays below,<br />With weeping eyes, through Paradise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
seem to see it go.</p>
<p>With troops of angels trying<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drive away
its fear,<br />I seem to hear it crying,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
want my mamma here.&rdquo;<br />I do not court the fancy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is not based on doubt,<br />It is a thought that comes unsought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
baby souls sail out.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>TO ANOTHER WOMAN&rsquo;S BABY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I list your prattle, baby boy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear your
pattering feet<br />With feelings more of pain than joy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
thoughts of bitter-sweet.</p>
<p>While touching your soft hands in play<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
passionate longings rise<br />For my wee boy who strayed away<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
soon to Paradise.</p>
<p>You win me with your infant art;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when
our play is o&rsquo;er,<br />The empty cradle in my heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems
lonelier than before.</p>
<p>Sweet baby boy, you do not guess<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How oft mine
eyes are dim,<br />Or that my lingering caress<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is
sometimes meant for <i>him.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>DIAMONDS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The tears of fallen women turned to ice<br />By man&rsquo;s cold
pity for repentant vice.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>RUBIES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>The crimson life-drops from a virgin heart<br />Pierced to the core
by Cupid&rsquo;s fatal dart.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SAPPHIRES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Lost rays of light that wandered off alone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
down through space were hurled<br />From that great sapphire sun beyond
our own<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale, puny little world.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>TURQUOISE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A baby went to heaven while it slept,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And,
waking, missed its mother&rsquo;s arms, and wept.<br />Those angel tear-drops,
falling earthward through<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s azure skies,
into the turquoise grew.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>REFORM</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The time has come when men with hearts and brains<br />Must rise
and take the misdirected reins<br />Of government; too long left in
the hands<br />Of aliens and of lackeys.&nbsp; He who stands<br />And
sees the mighty vehicle of State<br />Hauled through the mire to some
ignoble fate<br />And makes not such bold protest as he can,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is
no American,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A MINOR CHORD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I heard a strain of music in the street -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
wandering waif of sound.&nbsp; And then straightway<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
nameless desolation filled the day.<br />The great green earth that
had been fair and sweet,<br />Seemed but a tomb; the life I thought
replete<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy, grew lonely for a vanished
May.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgotten sorrows resurrected lay<br />Like
bleaching skeletons about my feet.</p>
<p>Above me stretched the silent, suffering sky,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumb
with vast anguish for departed suns<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
brutal Time to nothingness has hurled.<br />The daylight was as sad
as smiles that lie<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the wistful, unkissed
mouths of nuns,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I stood
prisoned in an awful world.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>DEATH&rsquo;S PROTEST</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Why dost thou shrink from my approach, O Man?<br />Why dost thou
ever flee in fear, and cling<br />To my false rival, Life?&nbsp; I do
but bring<br />Thee rest and calm.&nbsp; Then wherefore dost thou ban<br />And
curse me?&nbsp; Since the forming of God&rsquo;s plan<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have not hurt or harmed a mortal thing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have
bestowed sweet balm for every sting,<br />And peace eternal for earth&rsquo;s
stormy span.</p>
<p>The wild mad prayers for comfort sent in vain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
knock at the indifferent heart of Life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I,
Death, have answered.&nbsp; Knowest thou not &rsquo;tis he,<br />My
cruel rival, who sends all thy pain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wears
the soul out in unending strife?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
dost thou hold to him, then, spurning me?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SEPTEMBER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>My life&rsquo;s long radiant Summer halts at last,<br />And lo! beside
my path way I behold<br />Pursuing Autumn glide: nor frost nor cold<br />Has
heralded her presence; but a vast<br />Sweet calm that comes not till
the year has passed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its fevered solstice, and
a tinge of gold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subdues the vivid colouring of
bold<br />And passion-hued emotions.&nbsp; I will cast</p>
<p>My August days behind me with my May,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor
strive to drag them into Autumn&rsquo;s place,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor
swear I hope when I do but remember.<br />Now violet and rose have had
their day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll pluck the soberer asters
with good grace<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And call September
nothing but September.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>WAIL OF AN OLD-TIMER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Each new invention doubles our worries an&rsquo; our troubles,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
scientific fellows are spoilin&rsquo; of our land;<br />With motor,
wire, an&rsquo; cable, now&rsquo;-days we&rsquo;re scarcely able<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
walk or ride in peace o&rsquo; mind, an&rsquo; &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t safe
to stand.</p>
<p>It fairly makes me crazy to see how tarnal lazy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
risin&rsquo; generation grows - an&rsquo; science is to blame.<br />With
telephones for talkin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; messengers for walkin&rsquo;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
young men sit an&rsquo; loaf an&rsquo; smoke, without a blush o&rsquo;
shame.</p>
<p>An&rsquo; then they wer&rsquo;n&rsquo;t contented until some one
invented<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sort o&rsquo; jerky tape-line clock,
to help on wasteful ways.<br />An&rsquo; that infernal ticker spends
money fur &rsquo;em quicker<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any neighbourhood
o&rsquo; men in good old bygone days.</p>
<p>The risin&rsquo; generation is bent so on creation,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folks
haven&rsquo;t time to talk or sing or cry or even laugh.<br />But if
you take the notion to want some such emotion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;ve
got it all on tap fur you, right in the phonograph.</p>
<p>But now a crazy creature has introduced the feature<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
artificial weather, I think we&rsquo;re nearly through.<br />For when
we once go strainin&rsquo; to keep it dry or rainin&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
suit the general public, &rsquo;twill bust the world in two,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>WAS, IS, AND YET-TO-BE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>Was, Is, and Yet-to-Be<br />Were chatting over a cup of tea.</p>
<p>In tarnished finery smelling of must,<br />Was talked of people long
turned to dust;</p>
<p>Of titles and honours and high estate,<br />All forgotten or out
of date;</p>
<p>Of wonderful feasts in the long ago,<br />Of pride that perished
with nothing to show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loathe the present,&rdquo; said Was, with a groan;<br />&ldquo;I
live in pleasures that I <i>have</i> known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yet-to-be, in a gown of gauze,<br />Looked over the head of musty
Was,</p>
<p>And gazed far off into misty space<br />With a wrapt expression upon
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such wonderful pleasures are coming to me,<br />Such glory,
such honour,&rdquo; said Yet-to-be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one dreamed, in the vast Has-Been,<br />Of such successes
as I shall win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The past, the present - why, what are they?<br />I live for
the joy of a future day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then practical Is, in a fresh print dress,<br />Spoke up with a laugh,
&ldquo;I must confess</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find to-day so pleasant,&rdquo; she said,<br />&ldquo;I
never look back, and seldom ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever has been, is a finished sum;<br />Whatever will be
- why, let it come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day is mine.&nbsp; And so, you see,<br />I have the past
and the yet-to-be;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For to-day is the future of yesterday,<br />And the past of
to-morrow.&nbsp; I live while I may,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think the secret of pleasure is this.<br />And this
alone,&rdquo; said practical Is.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>MISTAKES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>God sent us here to make mistakes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strive,
to fail, to re-begin,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To taste the tempting fruit
of sin,<br />And find what bitter food it makes,</p>
<p>To miss the path, to go astray,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wander
blindly in the night;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, searching, praying
for the light,<br />Until at last we find the way.</p>
<p>And looking back along the past,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know we
needed all the strain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fear and doubt and strife
and pain<br />To make us value peace, at last.</p>
<p>Who fails, finds later triumph sweet;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who
stumbles once, walks then with care,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knows
the place to cry &ldquo;Beware&rdquo;<br />To other unaccustomed feet.</p>
<p>Through strife the slumbering soul awakes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
learn on error&rsquo;s troubled route<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truths
we could not prize without<br />The sorrow of our sad mistakes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>DUAL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>You say that your nature is double; that life<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems
more and more intricate, complex, and dual,<br />Because in your bosom
there wages the strife<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twixt an angel
of light and a beast that is cruel -<br />An angel who whispers your
spirit has wings,<br />And a beast who would chain you to temporal things.</p>
<p>I listen with interest to all you have told,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
now let me give you my view of your trouble:<br />You are to be envied,
not pitied; I hold<br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That every strong nature
is always made double</i>.<br />The beast has his purpose; he need not
be slain:<br />He should serve the good angel in harness and chain.</p>
<p>The body that never knows carnal desires,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
heart that to passion is always a stranger,<br />Is merely a furnace
with unlighted fires;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sends forth no warmth
while it threatens no danger.<br />But who wants to shiver in cold safety
there?<br /><i>Touch flame to the fuel</i>! then watch it with care.</p>
<p>Those wild, fierce emotions that trouble your soul<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
sparks from the great source of passion and power;<br />Throne reason
above them, and give it control,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turn into
blessing this dangerous dower.<br />By lightnings unguided destruction
is hurled,<br />But chained and directed they gladden the world.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE ALL-CREATIVE SPARK</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Pain can go guised as joy, dross pass for gold,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vulgarity
can masquerade as wit,<br />Or spite wear friendship&rsquo;s garments;
but I hold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That passionate feeling has no counterfeit.<br />Chief
jewel from Jove&rsquo;s crown &rsquo;twas sent men, lent<br />For inspiration
and for sacrament.</p>
<p>Jove never could have made the Universe<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had
he not glowed with passion&rsquo;s sacred fire;<br />Though man oft
turns the blessing to a curse,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burns himself
on his own funeral pyre,<br />Though scarred the soul be where its light
burns bright,<br />Yet where it is not, neither is there might.</p>
<p>Yea, it was set in Jove&rsquo;s resplendent crown<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
he created worlds; that done, why, hence,<br />He cast the priceless,
awful jewel down<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be man&rsquo;s punishment
and recompense.<br />And that is how he sees and hears our tears<br />Unmoved
and calm from the eternal spheres.</p>
<p>But sometimes, since he parted with all passion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
trifling mood, to pass the time away,<br />He has created men in that
same fashion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many women (jesting as gods
may),<br />Who have no souls to be inspired or fired,<br />Mere sport
of idle gods who have grown tired.</p>
<p>And these poor puppets, gazing in the dark<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
their own shadows, think the world no higher;<br />And when they see
the all-creative spark<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other souls, they straightway
cry out, &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;<br />And shriek, and rave, till their dissent
is spent,<br />While listening gods laugh loud in merriment.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>BE NOT CONTENT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Be not content - contentment means inaction;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
growing soul aches on its upward quest;<br />Satiety is twin to satisfaction;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
great achievements spring from life&rsquo;s unrest.</p>
<p>The tiny roots, deep in the dark mould hiding,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would
never bless the earth with leaf and flower<br />Were not an inborn restlessness
abiding<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In seed and germ, to stir them with its
power.</p>
<p>Were man contented with his lot forever,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
had not sought strange seas with sails unfurled,<br />And the vast wonder
of our shores had never<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawned on the gaze of
an admiring world.</p>
<p>Prize what is yours, but be not quite contented.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is a healthful restlessness of soul<br />By which a mighty purpose is
augmented<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In urging men to reach a higher goal.</p>
<p>So when the restless impulse rises, driving<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
calm content before it, do not grieve;<br />It is the upward reaching
of the spirit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the God in you to achieve -
achieve.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>ACTION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>For ever stars are winging<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their swift and
endless race;<br />For ever suns are swinging<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their
mighty globes through space.<br />Since by his law required<br />To
join God&rsquo;s spheres inspired,<br />The earth has never tired,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
whirled and whirled and whirled.<br />For ever streams are flowing,<br />For
ever seeds are growing,<br />Alway is Nature showing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
Action rules the world.</p>
<p>And since by God requested<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To <i>be</i>, the
glorious light<br />Has never paused or rested,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
travelled day and night.<br />Yet pigmy man, unseeing<br />The purpose
of his being,<br />Demands escape and freeing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
universal force.<br />But law is law for ever,<br />And like a mighty
lever<br />It thrusts him tow&rsquo;rd endeavour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
speeds him on his course.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>TWO ROSES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A humble wild-rose, pink and slender,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was
plucked and placed in a bright bouquet,<br />Beside a Jacqueminot&rsquo;s
royal splendour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both in my lady&rsquo;s
boudoir lay.</p>
<p>Said the haughty bud, in a tone of scorning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
wonder why you are called a rose?<br />Your leaves will fade in a single
morning;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No blood of mine in your pale cheek
glows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your coarse green stalk shows dust of the highway,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
have no depths of fragrant bloom;<br />And what could you learn in a
rustic byway<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fit you to lie in my lady&rsquo;s
room?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If called to adorn her warm, white bosom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
have you to offer for such a place,<br />Beside my fragrant and splendid
blossom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripe with colour and rich with grace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the sweet wild-rose, &ldquo;Despite your dower<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
finer breeding and deeper hue,<br />Despite your beauty, fair, high-bred
flower,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is I who should lie on her breast,
not you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For small account is your hot-house glory<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside
the knowledge that came to me<br />When I heard by the wayside love&rsquo;s
old story<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt the kiss of the amorous bee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SATIETY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>To yearn for what we have not had, to sit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
hungry eyes glued on the Future&rsquo;s gate,<br />Why, that is heaven
compared to having it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the power gone
to appreciate.</p>
<p>Better to wait and yearn, and still to wait,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
die at last with unappeased desire,<br />Than live to be the jest of
such a fate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that is my conception of hell-fire.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A SOLAR ECLIPSE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In that great journey of the stars through space<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About
the mighty, all-directing Sun,<br />The pallid, faithful Moon has been
the one<br />Companion of the Earth.&nbsp; Her tender face,<br />Pale
with the swift, keen purpose of that race<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which
at Time&rsquo;s natal hour was first begun,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines
ever on her lover as they run<br />And lights his orbit with her silvery
smile.</p>
<p>Sometimes such passionate love doth in her rise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down
from her beaten path she softly slips,<br />And with her mantle veils
the Sun&rsquo;s bold eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the gloaming
finds her lover&rsquo;s lips.<br />While far and near the men our world
call wise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See only that the Sun is in eclipse.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A SUGGESTION<br />To C. A. D.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Let the wild red-rose bloom.&nbsp; Though not to thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
delicately perfect as the white<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unwed lily
drooping in the light,<br />Though she has known the kisses of the bee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
tells her amorous tale to passers-by<br />In perfumed whispers and with
untaught grace,<br />Still let the red-rose bloom in her own place;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
could not be the lily should she try.</p>
<p>Why to the wondrous nightingale cry hush<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
bid her cease her wild heart-breaking lay,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
tune her voice to imitate the way<br />The whip-poor-will makes music,
or the thrush?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All airs of sorrow to one theme
belong,<br />And passion is not copyrighted yet.<br />Each heart writes
its own music.&nbsp; Why not let<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale
unchided sing her song?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE DEPTHS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Not only sun-kissed heights are fair.&nbsp; Below<br />The cold,
dark billows of the frowning deep<br />Do lovely blossoms of the ocean
sleep,<br />Rocked gently by the waters to and fro.<br />The coral beds
with magic colours glow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And priceless pearl-encrusted
molluscs heap<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glittering rocks where shining
atoms leap<br />Like living broken rainbows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so<br />We find the sea
of sorrow.&nbsp; Black as night<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sullen surface
meets our frightened gaze,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
down we sink to darkness and despair.<br />But at the depths - such
beauty! such delight!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such flowers as never grew
in pleasure&rsquo;s ways!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah!
not alone are sun-kissed summits fair.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LIFE&rsquo;S OPERA</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Like an opera-house is the world, I ween,<br />Where the passionate
lover of music is seen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the balcony near the
roof:<br />While the very best seat in the first stage-box<br />Is filled
by the person who laughs and talks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the
harmony&rsquo;s warp and woof.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE SALT SEA-WIND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When Venus, mother and maker of blisses,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose
out of the billows, large-limbed, and fair,<br />She stood on the sands
and blew sweet kisses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the salt sea-wind as
she dried her hair.</p>
<p>And the salt sea-wind was the first to caress her<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
praise her beauty and call her sweet,<br />The first of the whole wide
world to possess her,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, that creature of light
and heat.</p>
<p>Though the sea is old with its sorrows and angers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the world has forgotten why love was born,<br />Yet the salt sea-wind
is full of the languors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Venus taught on
her natal morn.</p>
<p>And now whoever dwells there by the ocean,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
feels the wind on his hair and face,<br />Is stirred by a subtle and
keen emotion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lingering spell of that first
embrace.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>NEW YEAR</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>New Year, I look straight in your eyes -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
ways and our interests blend;<br />You may be a foe in disguise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
I shall believe you a friend.<br />We get what we give in our measure,<br />We
cannot give pain and get pleasure;<br />I give you good will and good
cheer,<br />And you must return it, New Year.</p>
<p>We get what we give in this life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though often
the giver indeed<br />Waits long upon doubting and strife<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere
proving the truth of my creed.<br />But somewhere, some way, and for
ever<br />Reward is the meed of endeavour;<br />And if I am really worth
while,<br />New Year, you will give me your smile.</p>
<p>You hide in your mystical hand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No &ldquo;luck&rdquo;
that I cannot control,<br />If I trust my own courage and stand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
the Infinite strength of my soul.<br />Man holds in his brain and his
spirit<br />A power that is God-like, or near it,<br />And he who has
measured his force<br />Can govern events and their course.</p>
<p>You come with a crown on your brow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Year,
without blemish or spot;<br />Yet you, and not I, sir, must bow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
time is the servant of thought<br />Whatever you bring me of trouble<br />Shall
turn into good, and then double,<br />If my spirit looks up without
fear<br />To the Source that you came from, New Year.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CONCENTRATION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The age is too diffusive.&nbsp; Time and Force<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
frittered out and bring no satisfaction.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
way seems lost to straight determined action.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
shooting stars that zig-zag from their course<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
wander from our orbit&rsquo;s pathway; spoil<br />The r&ocirc;le we&rsquo;re
fitted for, to fail in twenty.<br />Bring empty measures, that were
shaped for plenty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last as guerdon for a life
of toil.<br />There&rsquo;s lack of greatness in this generation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
no more man centres on one thought.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know this
truth, and yet we heed it not:<br />The secret of success is Concentration.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Thoughts do not need the wings of words<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
fly to any goal.<br />Like subtle lightnings, not like birds,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
speed from soul to soul.</p>
<p>Hide in your heart a bitter thought -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still
it has power to blight;<br />Think Love - although you speak it not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
gives the world more light.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LUCK</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Luck is the tuning of our inmost thought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
chord with God&rsquo;s great plan.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
done, ah! know,<br />Thy silent wishes to results shall grow,<br />And
day by day shall miracles be wrought.<br />Once let thy being selflessly
be brought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To chime with universal good, and
lo!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What music from the spheres shall through
thee flow!<br />What benefits shall come to thee unsought!</p>
<p>Shut out the noise of traffic!&nbsp; Rise above<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
body&rsquo;s clamour!&nbsp; With the soul&rsquo;s fine ear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attune
thyself to harmonies divine -<br />All, all are written in the key of
Love.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep to the score, and thou hast naught
to fear;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements yet undreamed
of shall be thine.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to

TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including

          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
